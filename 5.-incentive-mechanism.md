# 5. Incentive mechanism

The token of SAMA network project is abbreviated as SAMA, with a total circulation of 2,100,000,000 SAMA tokens.

The SAMA protocol is a fee-based service protocol that also provides a paid computing power market. A certain amount of SAMA tokens will be burned in each settlement transaction, and SAMA tokens are required to be burned as gas fees (transaction fees) during the transfer process. These two factors contribute to the long-term deflationary economic model of SAMA tokens. Of course, the proportion of burned SAMA tokens in settlements can be revised through proposals.

The mining proportion of SAMA token is 60%. Among them, community users contribute to mining by providing computational power and bandwidth through hardware nodes, accounting for 20% of the total proportion. The remaining 40% of SAMA tokens are rewarded to contributors of community behaviors.

SAMA protocol and application developers based on SAMA protocol, as well as middleware-based application developers, work together to build DAO. The DAO organization defines the behavior of these users, which will be rewarded as a contribution to the ecosystem over a certain period of time. 40% of the rewards are allocated to creators, innovators, and their users. This ecosystem will spontaneously improve and self-replicate. Please follow the DAO community link on the SAMA official website.

Economic activities that occur within the community can be roughly divided into the following categories:

> * Staking SAMA tokens for validation nodes.
> * Audit nodes and work nodes pledge SAMA tokens.
> * Some economic actions defined by Entrepreneurs on the DAO.
> * Developers use the SAMA Protocol SDK & API to build web3 applications.
> * Users pay for the application product developed with the SAMA protocol.\
>

For developers in the ecosystem, the developed applications will receive corresponding subsidies. For users of ecosystem development projects, they need to purchase SAMA tokens to pay certain fees. For SAMA community members, SAMA tokens will serve as rewards for their continuous contributions to the community. For those who want to become auditor nodes and worker nodes of the SAMA sharding network, SAMA tokens will serve as a pledge tool for registering as a sharding network node. Additionally, SAMA tokens will be used to reward auditors for providing security and stability to the network, as well as workers for providing a large amount of services for network operation."
