# 7.1.2. Vote

Except for the initial setup by the root address, which requires a two-thirds vote from auditing node users, all other changes require a two-thirds vote from auditing node users.

Auditing node users can view proposal details on the decision-making page after logging into their wallet and, after verifying them, can vote on the proposal.

The voting method for ecological governance proposals is the same as the voting method for becoming an auditing or working node.
