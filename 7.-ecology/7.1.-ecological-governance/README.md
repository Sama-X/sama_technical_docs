# 7.1. Ecological governance

The modification of system parameters, addition of business types, and changes in fees for the SAMA protocol are all implemented through governance. Governance proposals require a two-thirds vote from auditing node users, and depending on the type of governance, different time intervals are required for the proposal to be executed after being approved by the vote.
