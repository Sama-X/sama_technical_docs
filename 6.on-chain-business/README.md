# 6.On-chain business

If a user wants to become an auditor or worker on the SAMA chain, it requires a two-thirds vote from the auditor user community. However, in the early stages of deployment, the root account controlled by the foundation will submit the first three audit nodes based on community voting results. Once the number of audit nodes reaches or exceeds three, the root account will no longer have any authority.

Note: The $id mentioned below should be replaced with the SAMA chain ID.

For users who want to become SAMA network protocol nodes, participate in the ecological governance of the SAMA network protocol, and other business users, this chapter will help you better participate in the daily business activities of the SAMA protocol.

The following sections will explain how to participate in on-chain business activities of the SAMA network protocol.
