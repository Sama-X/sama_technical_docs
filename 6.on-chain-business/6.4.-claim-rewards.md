# 6.4. Claim rewards

Auditing nodes, service nodes, verifier nodes, and foundations have made contributions to the SAMA ecosystem in different ways. SAMA rewards them with tokens, with different amounts depending on their roles (see the Economic Model for details).



Rewards need to be claimed manually, with a minimum interval of one week. The claiming address must be one of the foundation, auditing node, service node, or verification node.

Each contributor will calculate, compare and verify the Proof of Work transactions when claiming rewards, and those that meet the conditions will be given calculated rewards.
