# 2 .Overview

This document aims to help you learn and use the development tools of the SAMA platform, and help you better participate in the ecological construction of the SAMA platform. The following will introduce some basic concepts, as well as provide some topics you need to know about the SAMA protocol, as well as rich examples for developers and every ecological participant. You can choose a theme according to your needs:

### **Basic concepts：**

**SAMA Network:** Consists of the SAMA protocol and SE middleware.&#x20;

**SAMA Protocol:** Composed of consensus shards, proof-of-work shards, and SDK & API.

**SE Middleware:** A blockchain service platform that schedules node operation. It plays the role of distributed computation and scheduling entry for computing tasks, enabling the coordinated management of node computing resources and providing distributed computing services. At the same time, the middleware integrates relevant blockchain services and matches the integrated toolchain of the underlying protocol, providing new ways to enrich the ecosystem.

**SDK\&API:** Enables seamless integration of web2\&web3 applications with the SAMA protocol.

**Consensus shard:** A distributed network shard composed of a set of validators responsible for validating whether the auditing and working nodes comply with the operating rules of the SAMA protocol. Its main task is to ensure the security of the SAMA blockchain, validate the work submitted by proof-of-work shard nodes, and perform settlements.

**Proof-of-work shard:** A collection composed of auditing and working nodes responsible for providing main network services such as network information encryption and decryption, network acceleration, and distributed computing capabilities.

**Candidate node:** A node that has registered and submitted a request, but has not yet been approved by the audit node that is currently voting.

**Validator:** Responsible for validating blockchain transactions. The usual task is to validate whether the auditing and working nodes on the chain should be added to the SAMA network.

**Auditor:** Performs tasks such as work task distribution and statistics. Multiple auditing nodes form an auditing distributed network.

**Worker:** Responsible for the specific operation of work tasks. Multiple working nodes form a working distributed network.
