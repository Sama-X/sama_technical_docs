SAMA Protocol is committed to providing privacy-protected computing power services for various industries, which sets it apart from other products on the market.

The Orchid Protocol is an Ethereum Layer2 project that runs on the ETH network and has low performance. Users also need to pay expensive ETH gas fees when completing transactions, resulting in poor user experience. In contrast, the SAMA network protocol is based on Avalanche chain's sub-chains. It has low transaction costs for users, high throughput, and can support massive users, making it suitable for migrating large-scale Web2-era businesses to the Web3 era.

SAMA network nodes adopt a decentralized distribution method, where data is transmitted through auditing and working nodes. The efficiency of transmitting data is higher than that of the Orchid Protocol, but it does not compromise the security and privacy of accessing internet data.

The scalability of the SAMA network protocol is high, which will help developers with various business development goals and enhance the user experience of Web3-related applications.

The cost of building a service network environment is low. Because all nodes are distributed, any idle server node can be accessed. Therefore, the network cost is relatively low, and a large centralized IDC server cluster is not required to build a service network environment.

Distributed computing is a method of solving large-scale computing problems using idle processing power of computers on the Internet. Distributed computing decomposes applications into many small parts and distributes them to multiple computers to process. This can save overall computing time and greatly improve computing efficiency.

BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) is one of the mainstream distributed computing platforms. It is a distributed computing system developed by the computer science department at the University of California, Berkeley. The computing network is composed of computing resources provided by volunteers and enthusiasts around the world. Users need to submit tasks written in Python to the BOINC computing power market for task decomposition and allocation, and then the computing nodes in the distributed network complete the computing, which is then aggregated into the computing power market for results.

SAMA Protocol provides computing power scheduling services through a middleware layer. Users only need to submit computing tasks through the computing power scheduling platform. The platform decomposes the task into multiple sub-tasks and assigns them to the working nodes in the SAMA network, which are then completed by the auditing nodes and aggregated for final results.
