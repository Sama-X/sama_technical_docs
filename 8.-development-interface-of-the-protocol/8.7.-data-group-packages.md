# 8.7. Data group packages

1. The APP\_VERSION is 2 bytes (the current version of the auditor being 1).
2. The APP\_PUBLICKEY is 33 bytes long and is the compressed public key obtained after performing HexDecode.
3. 4 bytes represent the length of encrypted data by the auditor.
4.  Data to be encrypted by the auditor (in unencrypted format) is as follows:

    > 1 byte represents IPv4 or IPv6 (1 represents IPv4 and 2 represents IPv6).\
    > 4 bytes represent the worker's IPv4 address, while 16 bytes represent the worker's IPv6 address.\
    > 2 bytes represent the worker's port number.\
    > The workerPublicKeySha256 is 32 bytes long and represents the SHA256 hash of the worker's public key.\
    >
    >
    > > Illustrate:\
    > > a.If the IP address is IPv4, then the length of the auditor data source is 39 bytes. After encryption, its length becomes 105 bytes.\
    > > b.If the IP address is IPv6, then the length of the auditor data source is 51 bytes. After encryption, its length becomes 117 bytes.\
    > > c.The encryption algorithm used is chacha20-ietf-poly1305.\
    > > d.The key obtained by calculating the ECDH key using the private key of the encryption password app and the public key of the auditor is used as the password for encryption.
