# 8.4. Generation and import of public and private keys

Transactions on the blockchain require encryption and signature with a private key. Therefore, the application should support importing private keys from external sources and generating new private keys.

> The private key imported from external sources must meet the following conditions:
>
> * The length must be 64 bytes in hexadecimal encoding.
> * After decoding the hexadecimal value, the length must be 32 bytes, and the private key must be verified as valid using the secp256k1\_ec\_seckey\_verify function. If it is invalid, the user should be notified.
>
> The process of generating a private key within the client application is as follows:
>
> * Generate a random 32-byte number and verify the validity of the private key using the secp256k1\_ec\_seckey\_verify function.
> * Display the private key in hexadecimal encoding on the interface and calculate the address and display it on the interface.
