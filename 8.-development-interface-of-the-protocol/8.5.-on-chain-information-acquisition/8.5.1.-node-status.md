# 8.5.1. Node status

### health.health <a href="#1healthhealth" id="1healthhealth"></a>

Interface function: The node checks the operation every 30 seconds, and the interface returns the result of the last running status check. The client app verifies that the node is healthy, with a return value of true for normal, false for an exception, and if the exception can get data from another node.\
**Format:**

```
health.health() -> {
checks: []{
    checkName: {
            message: JSON,//A check response may include a message with additional context.
            error: JSON,//A check response may include an error describing why the check failed.
            timestamp: string,//timestamp is the timestamp of the last health check.
            duration: int,//duration is the execution duration of the last health check, in nanoseconds.
            contiguousFailures: int,//contiguousFailures is the number of times in a row this check failed.
            timeOfFirstFailure: int//timeOfFirstFailure is the time this check first failed.
    },
    healthy: bool//All chain inspection results are normal, then it is true
}
```

**Call curl example：**

```
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"health.health"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/health
```

**Example of returning results：**

```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "healthy": true
    },
    "id": 1
