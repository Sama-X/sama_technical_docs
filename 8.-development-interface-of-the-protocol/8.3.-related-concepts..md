Private key and public key address.

1.Both the private key and public key addresses are displayed in hexadecimal encoding in plaintext.\
2.The private key has a length of 64 bytes, the compressed public key has a length of 66 bytes, the uncompressed public key has a length of 130 bytes, and the address has a length of 42 bytes. For ease of understanding, examples of private and public keys are listed below:\


* Private key: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\

* Compressed public key：0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798\

* Uncompressed public key: 0479be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798483ada7726a3c4655da4fbfc0e1108a8fd17b448a68554199c47d08ffb10d4b8\

* Address:  0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf\


3.Private key generates public key, uncompressed public key generates address. The specific implementation process of these operations through code can be found in libraries 1 and 2.
