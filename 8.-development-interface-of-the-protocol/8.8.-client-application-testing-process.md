# 8.8. Client Application Testing Process

1.  Start listening on 127.0.0.1:8888 for Privoxy  \
       Description: HTTP proxy, which can convert HTTP packets into SOCKS5 data format\
      Configuration file: conf

    >   listen-address 127.0.0.1:8888\
    >   forward-socks5 / 127.0.0.1:9999\
    >
2. Start listening on 127.0.0.1:9999 for the client application.
3.  Process Testing

    > (1)curl -x 127.0.0.1:8888 [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com/)\
    > (2)Privoxy negotiates with the client application to convert HTTP requests into SOCKS5 protocol data and sends them to the client application.\
    > (3)After receiving the SOCKS5 data, the client application uses the AES-128-CFB algorithm and the ECDH key calculated by the APP PUBKEY and WORKER PUBKEY as the password to encrypt the data. The encrypted data is then used as the BODY.\
    > (4)Packaging as SamaHead (please refer to the packaging module for details).\
    > (5)Send the client application's HEAD and BODY to AUDITOR node.\
    > (6)Only the actual encrypted data needs to be sent, and there is no need to send the HEAD of the client application.\
