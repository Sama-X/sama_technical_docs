# 8. Development interface of the protocol

SAMA is applicable for the development and transformation of any WEB2 and WEB3 applications with privacy and security interconnection requirements. It is easy to develop and use, and for developers, there is no need to know the underlying implementation process of the encryption process. They only need to modify the network transmission part of their original APP and encapsulate the corresponding TCP data according to the protocol before pushing it to the server. Then they can receive and handle the data returned by the server.\
In order to help developers better use the SAMA network protocol to complete daily development work, the following will introduce how to use the SAMA network protocol to implement the development of application APPs.\
