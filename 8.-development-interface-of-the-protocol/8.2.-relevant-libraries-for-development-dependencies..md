# 8.2. Relevant libraries for   development dependencies.

For the convenience of developers in using SAMA for development, we recommend the following open source libraries to complete tasks such as public-private key generation, data encryption and decryption, and SOCKS5.

Developers can find the relevant libraries for their preferred programming language in the links below.\
Dependency library:\
[https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git)\
Calculate ECDH key (data encryption key), which can also be used for signing and verification：\
[https://github.com/chfast/ethash.git](https://github.com/chfast/ethash.git)\
To derive an address from a public key, the ethash\_keccak256 algorithm is required.\
