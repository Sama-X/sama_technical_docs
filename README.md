# 1.Introdution

[SAMA Network](https://sama.network/) is a new paradigm for building a blockchain system with high throughput, full-stack encryption of data, and distributed computing using an original design of consensus and business sharding separation (CBSP). Traditional privacy networks in blockchain are always based on asset on-chain and user-executed contract transactions to protect user privacy. SAMA, combining blockchain encryption technology, will build a more extensive, inclusive, and free network while providing distributed computing power.

Its goal is to become the next generation of blockchain OS for high-throughput, full-stack encrypted service computing power distribution, providing research and commercialization of computing services for mathematical, medical, astronomical, meteorological, AI models, while ensuring privacy protection of user data, access behavior data, and Internet data during interaction and transmission of Web2 and Web3 applications.

### &#x20;Characteristic advantages:

#### Support complex model calculations <a href="#zhi-chi-fu-za-mo-xing-ji-suan" id="zhi-chi-fu-za-mo-xing-ji-suan"></a>

A distributed network with workload sharding provides distributed computing power for complex model disassembly molecular tasks for distributed computing. The workload sharding node is used by the computing task scheduling center to allocate tasks and aggregate task execution results, thus realizing the function of multi Task parallelism.

#### Support application services for a large number of users <a href="#zhi-chi-ying-yong-fu-wu-hai-liang-yong-hu" id="zhi-chi-ying-yong-fu-wu-hai-liang-yong-hu"></a>

Low server operating costs. Any idle server device and bandwidth traffic can serve as a node. High throughput. Consensus sharding provides SAMA with exclusive blockchain throughput, while workload sharding provides transmission data security, privacy, and computing power.

#### Provide data privacy protection <a href="#ti-gong-shu-ju-yin-si-bao-zhang" id="ti-gong-shu-ju-yin-si-bao-zhang"></a>

The subnet provides security for blockchain, while the full stack encryption of network data transmission ensures the protection of application data security and privacy.

#### Supports high scalability and combination <a href="#zhi-chi-gao-kuo-zhan-he-zu-he" id="zhi-chi-gao-kuo-zhan-he-zu-he"></a>

Features can be combined. Provide privacy security protection and network acceleration for applications, and serve cross-border and cross regional computing power distribution. The network has high scalability. The workload sharding network node can add new features, functions, and is easy to expand.

> * protect personal data of Web2 and Web3 applications developed based on SAMA, data on Internet access behavior, and the privacy of users' Internet data during interactive transmission;
> * Provide distributed computing services;
> * Compress/decompress internet data;
> * Provide a cache for encrypted data.
