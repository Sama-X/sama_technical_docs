# 4.3.Confirmation of workload



On-chain transactions will generate workload for reaching consensus and verifying the consistency of blockchain data. Both working nodes and auditing nodes need to submit proofs of workload regularly and report relevant data to the consensus network slice. The auditing nodes will audit the workload, and upon passing the verification, validators will confirm the current workload and give rewards.
